## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: C# with .NET Core
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: Node.js and React

## Project Structure
Here's an overview of the project structure:

- `client/`: Front-end files
  - `src/`: Source code for the front-end
    - `components/`: Reusable UI components
    - `layouts/`: Application layouts
    - `pages/`: Application pages (Dashboard, Projects, etc.)
    - `styles/`: CSS/SASS files for styling
    - `utils/`: Utility functions (API requests, etc.)
    - `App.js`: Main React component
    - `index.js`: Front-end entry point
  - `public/`: Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
  - `package.json`: Front-end dependencies and build scripts
  - `README.md`: Front-end documentation

- `server/`: Back-end files
  - `controllers/`: API endpoints for CRUD operations and other services
  - `models/`: Data models for projects, tasks, users, etc.
  - `repositories/`: Data access layer interacting with MySQL
  - `services/`: Business logic for the back-end
  - `middleware/`: Middleware for server operations
  - `config/`: Configuration files (security, application settings, etc.)
  - `tests/`: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
  - `Dockerfile`: Docker configuration
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration
  - `.env`: Environment variables for sensitive information
  - `.gitignore`: Git ignore list for version control
  - `README.md`: Server documentation
  - `LICENSE`: License information
  - `CHANGELOG.md`: Change log for version history
  
- `schema.sql`: SQL schema for the database structure

## Installation and Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js, .NET Core, MySQL, and Git installed. If using Docker, ensure Docker is installed and running.
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd SoftwareProjectManagementSystem
3. Set up the environment variables: Create an .env file in the server/ directory with sensitive information like database credentials.
4. Install dependencies:
cd client/
npm install
cd ../server/
dotnet restore
5. Start the development servers:
Front-end: npm start (in client/)
Back-end: dotnet run (in server/)

## Usage
After setting up the project, you can access the front-end application via the default port (usually 3000) and interact with the back-end via API endpoints.

To create projects and tasks, follow the CRUD operations defined in the controllers. The front-end provides a user interface for managing projects, tasks, and users, as well as communication features.
Example workflow:
1. Create a project via the front-end or API.
2. Add tasks to the project, set deadlines, and assign resources.
3. Use the Kanban board to track task progress.
4. Communicate with team members through the real-time chat feature.
5. Generate reports to monitor project progress.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Commit your changes
4. Push your changes to your fork
5. Create a pull request

## Roadmap
This is a rough outline of the project's development timeline. The exact dates and tasks may change as the project progresses.

Week 1: Project Initialization and Backend Setup
Day 1:
Understand the requirements and scope of your project. Identify the key features to implement.
Set up your development environment for C# and ASP.NET Core.
Create the basic project structure and repository.
Day 2:
Implement the database schema in schema.sql. Design tables for projects, tasks, users, etc.
Connect your project to the MySQL database. Write configurations in appsettings.json and test the connection.
Day 3-4:
Begin implementing the backend. Start with essential models (Project, Task, User, etc.) and repositories to interact with the database.
Create basic controllers for CRUD operations (ProjectController, TaskController, UserController).
Implement simple middleware for authentication and error handling.
Day 5-6:
Add basic services to manage business logic (e.g., ProjectService, TaskService, UserService).
Write unit tests for models, repositories, and services. Start with a basic set of tests.
Day 7:
Review your progress. Integrate necessary libraries for additional features (e.g., JWT for authentication, Swagger for API documentation).
Set up Docker for containerization and create a basic Dockerfile.
Week 2: Frontend Setup and Basic Functionality
Day 1-2:
Set up the frontend environment with React, Angular, or Vue.js.
Create the basic project structure and establish communication with the backend (API requests).
Implement authentication and user registration on the frontend.
Day 3-4:
Create key frontend components and pages (e.g., ProjectCard, TaskList, Dashboard, ProjectDetails).
Implement basic UI/UX with CSS/SASS and a styling library (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS).
Day 5-6:
Add interactivity and state management for the frontend.
Implement CRUD operations for projects and tasks on the frontend.
Day 7:
Test end-to-end communication between the frontend and backend. Fix any integration issues.
Update unit and integration tests to ensure functionality.
